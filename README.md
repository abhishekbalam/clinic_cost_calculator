# A Clinic Cost Calculator

BeingDoc had conducted research into the cost of setting up with a clinic in many regions across India. This site is a front end to access, organise, analyse and show the data collected with a very good UI. I was responsible for converting complex excel data into relational database tables with MySql.

I do not own the data, but the code is presented here to show my work.

1)All the php scripts is in the scripts folder.
2)The sql not provided as I dont own the data
3)'I' and 'J' category items are ignored for the time being.
4)Try going to results page without going through the calculator page. :P
