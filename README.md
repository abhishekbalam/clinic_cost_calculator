# A Clinic Cost Calculator

BeingDoc had conducted research into the cost of setting up with a clinic in many regions across India. This site is a front end to access, organise, analyse and show the data collected with a very good UI. I was responsible for converting complex excel data into relational database tables with MySql.

I do not own the data, but the code is presented here to show my work.

A demo can be found [here](https://beingdoc.abhishekbalam.xyz)

Note: This is a very old project, and this repository is a copy of a private repo.
